        <p class="blog-post__text" style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;">
          The Uchiha clan is one of the four noble clans of Konohagakure, which has become famous as the strongest clan
          in the village thanks to its Sharingan and natural fighting prowess. <br>
          The Uchiha are descendants of Indra Otsutsuki, the eldest son of Hagoromo Otsutsuki. From Indra, they
          inherited his "eyes", which is why they possessed powerful spiritual energy and chakra. As part of the
          so-called "Curse of Hate", Uchiha are prone to intense emotions, which usually begin with love for a friend or
          family member and then turn into overwhelming hatred when they lose a loved one. This loss, regardless of
          whether it actually happened or if it was threatened, awakens the Uchih Sharingan. It is thanks to the
          Sharingan that the Uchiha have earned most of their good and bad fame for themselves.

          The Senju Clan is one of the clans responsible for the creation of the Hidden Leaf Village. along with their
          rivals, the Uchiha Clan. Although the clan apparently no longer exists, the Senju continue to influence
          Konoha's politics through their philosophy of the Will of Fire and their corresponding interpretation of the
          Hokage's position. Senju are descendants of Asura Otsutsuki, the youngest son of Hagoromo tsutsuki. Through
          Asura, they inherited his "body", possessing the most powerful vitality and chakra. Unlike most other clans,
          the Senju lacked only one particular trait in ability or fighting style; instead, the clan members were
          equally good at all ninja arts. Actually, it is because of this that they were nicknamed "Senju", which
          literally means "a thousand skills."

          The Uzumaki clan is the most famous clan of the Hidden Maelstrom Village. Since its disbandment, most of its
          known members have resided in Konohagakure, and Tsunade and the Seventh Hokage are descendants of the clan.
          The Uzumaki, being descendants of Asura tsutsuki, also shared a blood relationship with the Senju clan. Over
          the years, Uzumaki and Senju maintained close ties, whose members occasionally married between the clans, as
          with Hashirama Senju and Mito Uzumaki. After the founding of Konohagakure, at the end of the Age of Shinobi
          World Wars, Senju decided to symbolize the friendship of their clans by adding the Uzumaki emblem to the
          Konoha shinobi jackets.

        <p class="blog-post__text" style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;">
          The Otsutsuki clan is an ancient clan of celestial beings.
          As a parasitic species, they have spent thousands of years traveling through space, fulfilling their Will of
          цуtsutsuki, the belief that clan members consume life energy and genetic material from other worlds. to
          constantly evolve with the ultimate goal of achieving divinity. <br>

          Millennia ago, the clan sent Kaguya and Ishiki to cultivate the God Tree and collect the Chakra Fruit on
          Earth. Instead, Kaguya became attached to the planet they intended to destroy. <br>

          After that, after eating the Chakra Fruit of the Tree of this planet, Kaguya used the chakra that she
          possessed and the Infinite Tsukuyomi to end the endless wars between the human population of the Earth. The
          era of world peace was reached, so initially humanity worshiped Kaguya as a benevolent goddess. <br>

          At one time, Kaguya gave birth to twin sons, Hagoromo and Hamura, who possessed their own chakra from birth.
          Kaguya became enraged that they had inherited some of her power, so she merged with the Earth Divine Tree in
          an attempt to reclaim her by transforming into a monster known as the Ten-Tails. The latter wreaked havoc on
          the earth until Hagoromo and Hamura fought him and sealed him with the Six Paths - Chibaku Tensei, thus
          creating the moon. The Ten-Tails' chakra was sealed within Hagoromo, while its shell, the Demonic Statue of
          the Outer Path, was enclosed within the Moon to prevent the Ten-Tails from being reborn.

        <p class="blog-post__text" style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;">
          The Hyuuga clan is one of the four noble clans of the Hidden Leaf. Each member of this clan has a Byakugan
          from birth - an improved genome that grants them an expanded field of vision and the ability to see through
          solid objects and even, among other things, a chakra channel system. Members of this clan also have the unique
          ability to emit chakra from anywhere of their body. <br>
          The Hyuga clan originates from the tsutsuki Clan, namely from tsutsuki Hamura. As a consequence, they are also
          distant relatives of the Uchiha, Senju, Uzumaki and Kaguya clans. The Hyuuga clan is considered one of the
          most powerful clans in the Hidden Leaf. <br>
          The clan is divided into two parts: the Main Family and the Side Branch of the Family - a system that protects
          the secrets of the Byakugan from outsiders. The Main Branch rules the family, while the Side Branch protects
          it.

        <p class="blog-post__text" style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;">
          The Kaguya Clan is a now extinct clan known for its battle lust and archaic values, and the descendants of
          Kaguya tsutsuki, some of whom selectively inherited a derivative of her original ability to manipulate bone
          structure.
           <br>
          The members of the Kaguya clan were descendants of Kaguya tsutsuki and a rare member, namely Kimimaro,
          possessed an Enhanced Shikotsumyaku Genome derived from the original bone manipulation ability. However, this
          ability was still so powerful that even the war-loving Kaguya clan feared it.
           <br>
          As noted, the clan was extremely savage and always hungry for battle, developing absolutely no tactics during
          the battles they started just to show their brutality. It was because of their failed attempt to test
          themselves in this way that the entire clan was massacred during the attack on Kirigakure.
